This simple application is designed to ease time tracking so that you can focus on getting work done instead of having to mess with pen & paper, text files or spread sheet program.

Installation:
  * run the .msi file
  * application requires .NET 4 framework installed, if you don't have it you will be redirected to Microsoft's download page

  * manage daily tasks & report hours
  * every 15 minutes timer gives you 15 minutes to allocate for a task

  * unobtrusive persistence system (saving happens automatically, you don't need to remember to press save)

  * sticky tasks to automate creating repeating tasks (e.g. lunch)
